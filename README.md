## Task 1: RISC-V Toolchain Installation 
- Installation of RISC-V toolchain using the VDI link provided.
- The program demonstrates basic operations in C and their equivalent implementation in RISC-V assembly language.
    
## Task 2: Spike simulation and compiling c prigramming using RISC-V GCC
Spike (RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture Simulator) Spike is an emulator for the RISC-V ISA, often used to simulate and test RISC-V programs. It mimics the behavior of a RISC-V processor, allowing programs to run in a virtualized and controlled environment for development and debugging purposes.
-d Option (Debug Mode) The -d option in Spike activates debug mode. This mode facilitates detailed program execution by enabling step-by-step inspection of the processor's state, including registers and memory, to help diagnose and resolve issues.
Proxy Kernel (pk) The proxy kernel (pk) functions as a lightweight operating system within the RISC-V simulation. It manages system calls and supports the execution of programs in the simulated environment provided by Spike.
RISC-V Assembly Commands addi sp, sp, -16 (Add Immediate): This command subtracts 16 from the current value of the stack pointer (sp), effectively adjusting the stack pointer downwards. lui a0, 0x21 (Load Upper Immediate): This instruction loads the immediate value 0x31, shifted left by 12 bits, into the upper part of register a2.

## Task 3: Understanding RISC-V and Its Instruction Formats
# RISC-V Instruction Analysis
what is RISK-V
RISC-V is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) rooted in RISC principles, designed to optimize processors for specific applications.
As the fifth generation of RISC-based ISAs, RISC-V offers a flexible, free alternative to proprietary processor technologies.
With its open and license-free nature, RISC-V empowers developers to create customized processors without the burden of licensing fees.
RISC-Vâ€™s open-source model fosters innovation and broadens the hardware development ecosystem, making it a compelling choice for modern processor design.

# RISC-V Instruction Formats

This document outlines the six primary instruction formats in the RISC-V architecture: R-format, I-format, S-format, B-format, U-format, and J-format. Each format serves a specific purpose and is structured to handle particular types of operations efficiently.

## 1. R-format (Register-Register Operations)
- **Purpose**: Used for instructions that perform arithmetic and logical operations between two registers.
- **Fields**:
  | **Field**   | **Bits** | **Description**          |
  |-------------|----------|--------------------------|
  | `opcode`    | 7        | Specifies the operation  |
  | `rd`        | 5        | Destination register     |
  | `funct3`    | 3        | Operation subtype        |
  | `rs1`       | 5        | Source register 1        |
  | `rs2`       | 5        | Source register 2        |
  | `funct7`    | 7        | Further specifies the operation |

## 2. I-format (Immediate Operations)
- **Purpose**: Used for operations involving immediate values, such as arithmetic with constants or load instructions.

  | `funct3`    | 3        | Operation subtype        |
  | `rs1`       | 5        | Source register          |
  | `imm`       | 12       | Immediate value          |

## 3. S-format (Store Operations)
- **Purpose**: Used for storing data from a register to memory.
- **Fields**:
  | **Field**   | **Bits** | **Description**          |
